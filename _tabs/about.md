I started my career started with Office365 and Microsoft Exchange providing expert guidance to Microsoft customers by understanding their queries. Later, I got a change to work on the database technologies like MS SQL, Postgres, etc. and automating all the daily operations for a database engineer. For the past 8 years, I have been continously learning multiple cloud and devops technologies (listed below) with hand-on experience on multiple projects.




In my spare time I like to go on short day cycle trips to enjoy the weather and stay fit. The maximum distance that I have been able to acheive in a trip was 80 kms.
