## Problem Statement: E-Commerce Platform on Cloud


## Business Requirements:
1. **Scalability:** The platform should handle high traffic during peak shopping seasons without performance degradation.
2. **High Availability:** Ensure minimal downtime to provide a seamless shopping experience.
3. **Data Security:** Protect sensitive customer data and ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
4. **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize resource usage to minimize costs while maintaining performance.
5. **Disaster Recovery:** Implement a robust disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.

## Technical Requirements:
1. **Web Application:** Host the main e-commerce website that includes product listings, user accounts, and a shopping cart.
2. **Database:** Use a relational database to manage product inventory, customer information, and orders.
3. **Search Functionality:** Implement a fast and scalable search service for product queries.
4. **Content Delivery:** Use a CDN to deliver static content like images and videos quickly to users worldwide.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging to track performance, errors, and user activity.

## Solution Design:

### Core Components:

1. **Web Application:**
   - Use **Compute Instances** or **Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)** offerings to host the web application for easy scaling and management.
   - Deploy multiple instances across different **Regions** and **Availability Zones** for high availability.

2. **Database:**
   - Use a **Managed Relational Database Service** for relational data storage with automated backups and multi-region replication.
   - Implement a **NoSQL Database** for handling unstructured data if needed for certain parts of the application.

3. **Search Functionality:**
   - Use a **Managed Search Service** for a robust, scalable search solution.

4. **Content Delivery:**
   - Use a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** to deliver static content globally, reducing latency and improving load times.

5. **Storage:**
   - Use **Object Storage** for storing large objects like images, videos, and backups.

6. **Authentication and Security:**
   - Use **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** for identity and access management.
   - Implement a **Key Management Service (KMS)** to manage secrets and encryption keys.

7. **Networking:**
   - Use a **DNS Service** for DNS routing and traffic management.
   - Set up a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** or **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** for secure communication between services.
   - Implement **Firewall Rules** and a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for enhanced security.

8. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use **Monitoring and Logging Services** for monitoring and logging application performance and security events.
   - Implement **Tracing and Profiling Tools** for detailed application telemetry.

9. **Disaster Recovery:**
   - Set up a **Backup and Disaster Recovery Service** for regular backups of databases and other critical resources.
   - Implement cross-region replication and failover strategies for high availability.
