## Problem Statement: E-Commerce Platform on Azure

### Business Requirements:
1. `Scalability`: The platform should handle high traffic during peak shopping seasons without performance degradation.
2. `High Availability`: Ensure minimal downtime to provide a seamless shopping experience.
3. `Data Security`: Protect sensitive customer data and ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR.
4. `Cost Efficiency`: Optimize resource usage to minimize costs while maintaining performance.
5. `Disaster Recovery`: Implement a robust disaster recovery plan to ensure business continuity.

### Technical Requirements:
1. `Web Application`: Host the main e-commerce website that includes product listings, user accounts, and a shopping cart.
2. `Database`: Use a relational database to manage product inventory, customer information, and orders.
3. `Search Functionality`: Implement a fast and scalable search service for product queries.
4. `Content Delivery`: Use a CDN to deliver static content like images and videos quickly to users worldwide.
5. `Monitoring and Logging`: Implement monitoring and logging to track performance, errors, and user activity.

### Solution Design:

1. `Web Application`
- Use Azure App Service to host the web application for easy scaling and management.
- Deploy multiple instances across different Azure Regions for high availability.

2. `Database`
- Use Azure SQL Database for relational data storage with automated backups and geo-replication.
- Implement Azure Cosmos DB for handling NoSQL data if needed for certain parts of the application.

3. `Search Functionality`
- Use Azure Cognitive Search for a robust, scalable search solution with built-in AI capabilities.

4. `Content Delivery`
- Use Azure CDN to deliver static content globally, reducing latency and improving load times.

4. `Storage`
- Use Azure Blob Storage for storing large objects like images, videos, and backups.

5. `Authentication and Security`
- Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) for identity and access management.
- Implement Azure Key Vault to manage secrets and encryption keys.

6. `Networking`
- Use Azure Front Door for global routing and load balancing.
- Set up Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for secure communication between services.
- Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall for enhanced security.

7. `Monitoring and Logging`
- Use Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for monitoring and logging application performance and security events.
- Implement Application Insights for detailed application telemetry.

8. `Disaster Recovery`
-  Set up Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery of VMs and other critical resources.
- Implement regular backups using Azure Backup.
