## Problem Statement: Email Journaling for Compliance and Security

### Business Requirements:
1. **Compliance:** Ensure that all email communications are archived in accordance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, or Sarbanes-Oxley.
2. **Data Security:** Protect archived emails from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.
3. **Auditability:** Provide a robust auditing mechanism to trace and review email communications for compliance and security purposes.
4. **Scalability:** The solution should handle a growing volume of email traffic as the business expands.
5. **Cost Efficiency:** Optimize resource usage to minimize costs while maintaining performance and compliance.

### Technical Requirements:
1. **Email Archiving:** Implement email journaling to capture and store copies of all email communications.
2. **Data Storage:** Use a secure and scalable storage solution for archived emails.
3. **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access archived emails.
4. **Data Encryption:** Encrypt emails at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement monitoring and logging to track access and modifications to archived emails.
6. **Data Retention:** Define and enforce data retention policies to comply with regulatory requirements.
7. **Disaster Recovery:** Implement a disaster recovery plan to ensure that archived emails can be recovered in case of data loss.

### Solution Design:

1. **Email Journaling:**
   - Set up email journaling to capture all incoming and outgoing emails from the email server.
   - Route journaled emails to a secure archiving solution.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Use a **Secure Storage Service** to store archived emails with redundancy and high availability.
   - Implement **Data Lifecycle Management** to automate retention and deletion policies.

3. **Access Control:**
   - Use **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** to enforce strict access controls based on roles and permissions.
   - Implement **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for additional security.

4. **Data Encryption:**
   - Encrypt emails at rest using **Encryption Services**.
   - Use **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** to encrypt emails in transit.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Use **Monitoring Services** to track access and modifications to archived emails.
   - Implement **Logging Services** to maintain an audit trail of all actions performed on the archived emails.

6. **Disaster Recovery:**
   - Set up **Backup Services** for regular backups of archived emails.
   - Implement **Disaster Recovery Plans** to ensure email archives can be restored in case of failure.
