## WebSocat
- WebSocket is a two-way communication protocol over a TCP. 
- Websocat is a tool that allows to use WebSocket client or server via command line. 
- It can operate in client mode and connect to WebSocket server or operate in server mode and accept connections from WebSocket clients.

### Installation
1. Install Websocat
- Download the latest Websocat executable file from the releases page in GitHub repository:
```
sudo wget -qO /usr/local/bin/websocat https://github.com/vi/websocat/releases/latest/download/websocat.x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```

2. Set execute permission:
```
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/websocat
```

3. Now websocat will be available for all users as a system-wide command. Check the version using the below command:
```
websocat --version
```


### Testing Websocat
- We can run the websocat command and provide WebSocket server URL as argument to connect to the server. 
- For example, the following command connects to public WebSocket echo server:
```
websocat wss://echo.websocket.events
```
- Now you can type something and press the Enter key. A server will send the same message back.

```
user@linuxhost:~$ websocat wss://echo.websocket.events

1. The -s option can be used to start WebSocket server. Provide the port number as argument.
```
websocat -s 8080
```

2: Now open another terminal on your system and run the following command to connect to local WebSocket server:
```
websocat ws://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Uninstall Websocat
