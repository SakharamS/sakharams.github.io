## Introduction
- An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. 
- It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware, allowing users to interact with the system and run applications.
- Operating systems perform various functions, including process management, memory management, file system management, device management, and user interface management. 
- They provide a platform for running applications and ensure that different programs can run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

### Key Roles of OS
- One of the key roles of an operating system is to manage system resources efficiently. 
- It allocates memory, CPU time, and other resources to different processes and ensures that they are used effectively. 
- It also provides mechanisms for process synchronization and communication, allowing processes to cooperate and share data.

### Important Aspects
- Another important aspect of operating systems is their ability to provide a secure and reliable environment for running applications. 
- They enforce access control policies, protect against unauthorized access, and provide mechanisms for error handling and recovery.

### Types of OS:
- Operating systems come in different types:
1. Windows
2. macOS
3. Linux
4. Unix. 
- Each operating system has its own features, design principles, and target audience.
