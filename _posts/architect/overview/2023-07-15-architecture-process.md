## Introduction
- Below are the steps followed to desing an architecture:


## 1. Understand the System's Requirements
- `Description`: 
    This initial step involves understanding what the system should accomplish, essentially defining the functional requirements.
- `Tasks`:
    + Clarify goals set by stakeholders.
    + Collaborate with system analysts to define detailed functional requirements.
    + Ensure clarity on what tasks the system needs to perform.

### 2. Understand the Non-Functional Requirements
- `Description`: 
    Non-functional requirements focus on technical and service-level attributes such as performance, scalability, security, and reliability.
- `Tasks`:
    + Define metrics like user loads, transaction volumes, and expected performance benchmarks.
    + These are often derived from technical constraints and operational needs, not always explicitly stated by clients or analysts.

### 3. Map the Components
- `Description`: 
    This step involves visually representing the tasks and interactions within the system to understand its functionality.
- `Tasks`:
    + Create diagrams or flowcharts to depict system processes and interactions.
    + Facilitate understanding and communication between architects, developers, and stakeholders.
    + Ensure that non-technical stakeholders can grasp the system's workings.

### 4. Select the Technology Stack
- `Description`: 
    Choose appropriate technologies and frameworks for different layers of the application (backend, frontend, data storage, etc.).
- `Tasks`:
    + Evaluate technologies based on functional and non-functional requirements.
    + Consider factors like scalability, compatibility, and industry best practices.
    + Ensure alignment with organizational standards and existing infrastructure.

### 5. Design the Architecture
- `Description`: 
    - Design the overall structure and interaction patterns of the system based on requirements and selected technologies.
- `Tasks`:
    + Define high-level components/modules and their interactions.
    + Specify communication protocols and data formats.
    + Address key architectural concerns such as scalability, reliability, and maintainability.

### 6. Write Architecture Document
- `Description`: 
    Document the architecture to provide a comprehensive overview for stakeholders, developers, and support teams.
- `Tasks`:
    + Structure the document to include sections on architecture overview, components, deployment diagrams, and technology choices.
    + Describe rationale behind design decisions and trade-offs.
    + Ensure documentation is clear, concise, and accessible to all relevant parties.

### 7. Support the Team
- `Description`: 
    Provide ongoing support to development and operational teams as they implement and maintain the system.
- `Tasks`:
    + Collaborate with developers to clarify architectural guidelines and resolve design issues.
    + Update architecture documentation as the system evolves.
    + Assist support teams in understanding system architecture to troubleshoot issues effectively.


### Architecting for the Cloud:
1. Emphasis on existing services on the cloud
- Benefits:
    + Better SLA
    + Automation
    + Scaling
    + Security
    
2. Emphasis on Cost optimization
- Capex vs OpEx
