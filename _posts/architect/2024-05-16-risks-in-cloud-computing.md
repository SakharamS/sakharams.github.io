Cloud computing, while offering numerous benefits, also comes with its own set of risks. Here are some of them:

1. `Data Breaches`: 

    - The most common risk in cloud computing is data breaches, where unauthorized users gain access to confidential data.
    - Controls:
        + Implement strong access controls to ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive data.
        + Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
        + Regularly update and patch systems to fix any known vulnerabilities.
        + Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
        + Implement a robust incident response plan to quickly react in case of a breach.

2. `Data Loss`: 

    - Data stored in the cloud can be lost due to reasons like accidental deletion, malicious attacks, or even a physical catastrophe at the data center.
    - Controls:
        + Regular Backups: Regularly backup data to ensure a copy is available in case of data loss. This could be to another cloud provider or a different region of the same provider.
        + Data Replication: Replicate data across multiple regions to ensure availability in case of a region-specific issue.
        + Disaster Recovery Plan: Implement a robust disaster recovery plan that details how to recover data in case of a loss.
        + Access Controls: Implement strong access controls to prevent accidental deletion of data by unauthorized individuals.
        + Data Encryption: Encrypt data at rest to protect against data loss from breaches.
        + Versioning: Use versioning of data to recover from accidental deletions or modifications.
        + Monitoring and Alerts: Implement monitoring and alerts to detect and notify of any potential data loss incidents as soon as they occur.

3. `Service Traffic Hijacking`: 

    - Attackers can gain access to your credentials and eavesdrop on your activities and transactions, manipulate data, or redirect clients to illegitimate sites.
    - Controls:
        + Use strong, complex passwords and change them regularly.
        + Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.
        + Encrypt data in transit to prevent interception.
        + Regularly monitor and log activities to detect any unusual patterns or anomalies.
        + Educate employees about phishing and other social engineering attacks.

4. `Insecure APIs`: 

    - Cloud services are accessed through APIs, and if these are insecure, they can be exploited by attackers.
    - Controls:
        + Use authentication and authorization on all API endpoints to ensure only authorized users can access them.
        + Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the APIs.
        + Regularly update and patch APIs to fix any known vulnerabilities.
        + Use encryption for data in transit to and from the APIs.
        + Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments of your APIs.

5. `Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks`: 

    - These attacks can make your cloud services unavailable for legitimate users by overwhelming the system with traffic.
    - Control: 
        + Implement rate limiting, anomaly detection, and traffic filtering. 
        + Use cloud services that can absorb the traffic load.

6. `Insufficient Due Diligence`: 

    - If a company doesn't understand the cloud environment and its associated risks before adopting cloud services, it can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    - Control: 
        + Conduct thorough due diligence before adopting cloud services. 
        + Understand the cloud provider's infrastructure, security measures, and compliance certifications.

7. `Abuse of Cloud Services`: 

    - Cloud-based resources can be used to conduct malicious activities, such as spreading malware or launching attacks.
    - Control: 
        + Implement strict access controls and monitor usage patterns to detect any abnormal activities. 
        + Use threat intelligence to understand potential threats.

8. `Shared Technology Vulnerabilities`: 

    - In a multi-tenant cloud environment, vulnerabilities in shared technology can affect multiple clients.
    - Control: 
        + Use a cloud service provider that follows best practices for security and isolation of resources. 
        + Regularly update and patch systems.

9. `Vendor Lock-In`: 

    - The difficulty of migrating from one cloud provider to another can lead to dependence on a single provider.
    - Control:  
        + Choose cloud providers that use standard, open-source technology. 
        + Implement a multi-cloud strategy if possible.

10. `Compliance Risks`: 

    - Depending on the industry, storing and processing data in the cloud may not comply with regulatory requirements.
    - Control: 
        + Understand the regulatory requirements for your industry. 
        + Choose a cloud provider that meets these requirements and can provide necessary documentation.
        + To mitigate these risks, it's important to have a robust security strategy in place, including encryption, access controls, regular audits, and a disaster recovery plan.
