#### Problem:

A company needs to host a web application with distinct traffic management for public and private users. The current infrastructure struggles with security, performance, and reliability, particularly in differentiating internal and external traffic routes.

#### Objective:

Implement a split-brain DNS architecture to:

Ensure secure, high-performance routing for public and private users.
Utilize Azure Front Door for public access and Azure Application Gateway for private access.
Integrate Azure DNS and ExpressRoute for seamless and secure traffic management.

#### Solution:


#### Components Involved
Google Cloud DNS: Manages DNS records for public and private DNS zones.
Google Cloud Load Balancer: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances.
Google Cloud CDN: Caches content for public access, reducing latency.
VPC Network: Isolates private and public subnet environments.
Cloud Interconnect: Provides dedicated, private connectivity from on-premises to Google Cloud.
Firewall Rules: Controls traffic to and from the instances.
Google Cloud Armor: Protects against DDoS attacks and other threats.
#### Security
Google Cloud Armor: Protects against web-based attacks.
Firewall Rules: Define ingress and egress traffic rules at the network level.
SSL/TLS Encryption: Ensures secure communication between clients and servers.
IAM Policies: Manage access to GCP resources with fine-grained permissions.
Cloud Interconnect: Secures private connections, minimizing public internet exposure.
This setup provides a secure, efficient, and highly available environment for web applications on GCP, catering to both public and private access requirements.
