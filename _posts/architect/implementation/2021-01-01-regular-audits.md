## Introduction
- Conducting regular audits after policy enforcement in CSP's involves several stages that are generally similar across all three cloud service providers. 

1. **Define Audit Scope and Objectives**
- `General`: Identify what needs to be audited, the policies in place, and the goals of the audit.
- `Azure`: Define the scope using Azure Policy and Azure Security Center.
- `AWS`: Define the scope using AWS Config Rules and AWS Security Hub.
- `GCP`: Define the scope using Google Cloud Asset Inventory and Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC).

2. **Collect Data and Logs**
- `General`: Gather relevant data and logs from cloud resources and services.
- `Azure`: Collect data using Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, and Activity Logs.
- `AWS`: Collect data using AWS CloudTrail, AWS CloudWatch, and AWS Config.
- `GCP`: Collect data using Stackdriver Logging, Cloud Audit Logs, and Cloud Asset Inventory.

3. **Analyze Compliance with Policies**
- `General`: Analyze the collected data to check compliance with the defined policies.
- `Azure`: Use Azure Policy compliance reports and Azure Security Center recommendations.
- `AWS`: Use AWS Config compliance reports and AWS Security Hub findings.
- `GCP`: Use Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) insights and Cloud Asset Inventory reports.

4. **Identify and Assess Violations**
- `General`: Identify any violations of policies and assess their impact.
- `Azure`: Identify violations using Azure Policy compliance results and Azure Security Center alerts.
- `AWS`: Identify violations using AWS Config non-compliant resources and AWS Security Hub alerts.
- `GCP`: Identify violations using Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) findings and IAM Policy Analyzer.

5. **Generate Audit Reports**
- `General`: Create detailed reports of the audit findings, including compliance status and violations.
- `Azure`: Generate reports using Azure Policy compliance dashboard and Azure Security Center reports.
- `AWS`: Generate reports using AWS Config compliance dashboard and AWS Security Hub reports.
- `GCP`: Generate reports using Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) dashboards and Cloud Asset Inventory reports.

6. **Remediate Issues**
- `General`: Address and remediate identified issues to ensure compliance.
- `Azure`: Remediate issues using Azure Automation, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Resource Manager templates.
- `AWS`: Remediate issues using AWS Systems Manager, AWS Lambda, and AWS CloudFormation.
- `GCP`: Remediate issues using Google Cloud Deployment Manager, Cloud Functions, and Policy Controller.

7. **Monitor Continuous Compliance**
- `General`: Implement continuous monitoring to ensure ongoing compliance with policies.
- `Azure`: Use Azure Policy for continuous compliance assessment and Azure Sentinel for security monitoring.
- `AWS`: Use AWS Config for continuous compliance assessment and AWS GuardDuty for security monitoring.
- `GCP`: Use Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC) for continuous compliance assessment and Security Health Analytics.

8. **Review and Update Policies**
- `General`: Regularly review and update policies to adapt to new requirements and threats.
- `Azure`: Update policies using Azure Policy and review security recommendations in Azure Security Center.
- `AWS`: Update policies using AWS Config Rules and review security findings in AWS Security Hub.
- `GCP`: Update policies using Google Cloud Organization Policy and review insights in Cloud Security Command Center (Cloud SCC).
