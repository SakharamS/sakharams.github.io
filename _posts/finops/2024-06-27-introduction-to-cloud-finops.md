## Introduction
- Cloud FinOps, or Cloud Financial Operations, is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud computing. 
- It involves collaboration between finance, engineering, technology, and business teams to manage cloud costs and usage effectively, ensuring that an organization can get the maximum value from its cloud investments.

### What is FinOps?
- `Practice` - Practice of bringing financial accountablility to the vraible spend model of cloud.
- `Enabler` - Enables distributed teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost and quality.
- `Culture` - At its core, FinOps is a cultural practice. It's the most efficient way in the world for teams to manage their cloud costs.
- `Teams` - Using FinOps, cross-functional teams work together to enable faster delivery, while at the same time gaining more financial and operational control.
- `Decisions` - With FinOps, each operational team (workload, service, product owner) can access the near real-time data they need to influence their spend and help them make intelligent decisions.
- `Formula` - Real time reporting + Just in time processes + teams working together = FinOps 


### Key Objectives of Cloud FinOps:
1. **Cost Management**: 
- Track, analyze, and manage cloud costs and usage to ensure efficient and cost-effective cloud operations.

2. **Optimization**: 
- Continuously optimize cloud resources and services to reduce waste and improve cost-efficiency.

3. **Accountability**: 
- Assign cloud costs to the appropriate teams or departments, encouraging accountability and responsible spending.

4. **Transparency**: 
- Provide clear visibility into cloud spending, enabling better decision-making and financial planning.

5. **Governance**: 
- Implement policies and controls to manage cloud usage and costs in a structured and compliant manner.

### Key Practices in Cloud FinOps:

1. **Budgeting and Forecasting**: 
- Predicting cloud costs and creating budgets to manage spending.

2. **Cost Allocation**: 
- Assigning cloud costs to specific projects, departments, or teams.

3. **Resource Tagging**: 
- Using tags to identify and categorize cloud resources for better tracking and management.

4. **Monitoring and Reporting**: 
- Regularly monitoring cloud usage and generating reports to understand spending patterns.

5. **Optimization Strategies**: 
- Implementing strategies like rightsizing, using reserved instances, and shutting down unused resources to optimize costs.

6. **Automation**: 
- Using automation tools to manage and optimize cloud resources and costs efficiently.

### Benefits of Cloud FinOps:
1. `Cost Savings`: Reduces unnecessary cloud spending through continuous monitoring and optimization.
2. `Operational Efficiency`: Streamlines cloud operations by promoting best practices and collaboration across teams.
3. `Better Financial Planning`: Enhances financial planning and budgeting with accurate cost forecasting and allocation.
4. `Increased Accountability`: Encourages responsible spending by making teams accountable for their cloud usage and costs.
5. `Enhanced Visibility`: Provides detailed insights into cloud spending, enabling better decision-making and resource management.


### Metrics
- Unit Economics: Idea is to measure cloud spend againsta business metric (total revenue, shipments made, paid subscribers, customer orders completed, etc), which in practice is complete to achieve.

### Phases of FinOps
1. `Inform`
- Get visibility and create shared accountability by showing teams what they are spending and why.

2. `Optimize`
- Empower the teams to identify and measure efficiency optimizations, then make goals and strategies based on those opportunities.

3. `Operate`
- Define and execute processes aligned with the goals of Technology, Finance and business.
