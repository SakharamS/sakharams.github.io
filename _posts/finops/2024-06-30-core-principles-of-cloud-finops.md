## Core Principles and Phases of Cloud FinOps

### Core Principles of Cloud FinOps
1. **Ownership**
- Everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage.

2. **Collaboration**
- Teams needs to collaborate, and a centralized team drives FinOps

3. **Decisions**
- Decisions are driven by the business value of cloud.

4. **Cost Model**
- Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud.

5. **Reports**
- FinOps reports should be accessible and timely.

### Phases of FinOps
1. **Inform**
- Get visibility and create shared accountability by showing teams what they are spending and why.

2. **Optimize**
- Empower the teams to identify and measure efficiency optimizations, then make goals and strategies based on those opportunities.

3. **Operate**
- Define and execute processes aligned with the goals of Technology, Finance and business.

### Metrics
- Unit Economics: Idea is to measure cloud spend againsta business metric (total revenue, shipments made, paid subscribers, customer orders completed, etc), which in practice is complete to achieve.

### Important Terms in Cloud FinOps
1. `Cost Allocation`
- Splitting up a cloud bill and associating the costs to each cost center.
2. `Wasted Usage`
- Resource usage that isn't actively used by an organization.
3. `RightSizing`
- Act of changing the size of provisioned resources to one that better matches needs.
4. `On-Demand Rate`
- The normal or base rate paid for a cloud resource.
5. `Rate Reduction`
- Using Reserved Instances (RIs), Committed Use Discounts (CUDs), or commercial agreeements between an organisation and a cloud service provider in order to receive a lower rate for the used resources.
6. `Cost Avoidance`
- By reducing resource usage, either by removing a resource altogether or by rightsizing it, you can avoid paying for resources that would have incurred a charge.
7. `Cost Savings`
- By reducing the rate you pay for resources, you generate savings.
8. `Saving Potential`
- When looking at your cloud bill forecasts, you can predict the amount of saving using your existing commitments and commercial agreements.
9. `Savings realized`
- By reducing the rate you page for resources, you generate savings.
10. `Reservations/Commitments`
- By precommitting to a cloud service provider a set amount of resource usage using RIs or CUDs, you receive a reduction in the rate normally paid for those resources.
11. `Reservations Unused/Unutilized`
- For every hour you have committed to a resource usage that you dont use, thatreservation goes unused, or unutilized. Another terms for this is reservation capacity.
13. `Reservation Waste`
- Having a reservation with some amount of underutilization isnt an issue as longs as the discount you're receiving is larger than the cost of the unused reservation.
14. `Covered Usage`
- When a resource charge is discounted by a reservation, you call it covered.
15. `Coverable Usage`
- Not all usage in the cloud is coverable with a reservation.
16. `Unblended Rates`
- Some resources are charged in decreasing rates the more you use them
16. `Blended Rates`
- Some cloud service providers offer a blended rate in their billing data. This blended rate standardizes the rate you page ofr the same type of resource by evenly distributing the charges to each resource.
17. `Amortization`
- Costs that happended during a previous accounting period related to the current period based on the accumulated benefit during this period.
18. `Amortized Costs`
- Some cloud resources and reservation come with an upfront fee.
19. `Fully Loaded Costs`
- Fully loaded costs are amortized, reflect the actual discounted rates a company is paying for cloud resources, equitably factor in shared costs, and are mapped to the business's organizational structure.
20. `Matching Principle`
- Expenses should be recorded in the preiod in which the values was received, not neccessarily during the period the cloud provider invoiced then or when payment was made.
21. `Capex vs OpeX`
- Capital expenditures are major purchases that a company makes, which are used over the long term. 
- Operating expenses, on the other hand, are the day-to-day expenses that a company incurs to keep its business running.
22. `Cost of Capital/WACC`
- Cost of Capiltal refers to the cost to an enterprise to deploy their money toward an investment.
23. `COGS`
- Cost of goods sold measures how many dollars of outlay it takes to generate revenue in a specific period.
24. `Net Present Value(NPV)`
- In a cloud business case, the net present value of all the cash flows of a no-upfront RI might be compared to the current cash value of the all-upfront RI for determining which is better for the business.
- It is most important for a finops team to determine the present value of future benefits when using reservations.
25. `Unit Economics`
- It is the comparison between the total cloud cost that is required to produce a give unit of value to the organization.
26. `Showback`
- It is to identify all the charges on a cloud billing and then to associate them with the specific cost center that should pay for them.
27. `CSP`
- Cloud Solution Provider such as AWS, Azure or GCP.
