## Introduction
- `Web application scanning` is a process in which automated tools identify and pinpoint potential risks in web applications that cyber criminals could exploit. 
- It is important to mitigate these risks, especially before the web application is introduced in the market. 
- This helps the business maintain trust and reputation. This is also needed for businesses to avoid any kind of data theft on the internet.
- A cybersecurity firm scans and recommends various steps to mitigate these potential risks in a report. 
- Vulnerabilities like SQL injection and misconfigurations affect web applications and cost money to businesses and firms.


### What does Web Application Scanning Do?
- It is a process that involves scanning web-based applications to identify their security posture and mitigate potential risks. Here is what web applications do:

1. `Identifies Vulnerabilities`
- During a web application scanning, various vulnerabilities are uncovered and these vulnerabilities could potentially harm the application. 
- Here are some vulnerabilities that could affect the applications:
    + SQL Injection
    + Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    + Insecure Configurations
    + Outdated Software

2. `Simulates Attacks`
- The automated scanning tools simulate real attacks on the web app. 
- This means it shows hackers and cyber criminals could potentially exploit the gaps and weaknesses. 
- This helps in identifying how the application would respond to the attacks and thus a solution could be devised and improve the security of that application.

3. `Provides Detailed Reports`
- After simulating the attacks, the automated tools provide detailed reports of the application’s security posture. 
- This report generally includes the below-stated information.
    + Description of the Vulnerability
    + Severity Levels
    + Recommendations for remediation

4. `Helps Ensure Compliance`
- Various industries require various compliance requirements like GDPR, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, etc. 
- To get these compliance certifications, industries, and businesses need to conduct regular security assessments. 
- Web application scanning helps firms with compliance requirements and meet specific standards.

5. `Supports Continuous Security`
- With the continuous increase in rising vulnerabilities, there is also an evolving need for security measures for web-based applications. 
- To counter-attack these vulnerabilities continuous web application scanning is necessary.


### Benefits of Web Application Scanning
- This scanning method offers various benefits that help businesses and firms protect their web applications from potential security risks. Here are some key benefits:

| Benefit | Description | 
| ------- | ----------- |
| Early Detection of Vulnerabilities | Identifies security issues early, allowing them to be fixed before exploitation. |
| Cost-Effective Security |	Prevents costly incidents by addressing vulnerabilities during development. |
| Enhanced Security Posture | Maintains strong security by regularly identifying and fixing vulnerabilities. |
| Compliance with Regulations | Helps meet industry regulations requiring regular security assessments. |
| Protection of Sensitive Data | Safeguards personal and financial information by addressing vulnerabilities. |


### Challenges for Web Application Scanning
- It is an essential process that helps organizations build their security posture but it also comes with various challenges. The challenges for web application scanning include:

1. `False Positives and Negatives`: 
- Scanners may incorrectly identify vulnerabilities. Thus, leading to inefficient reports and potential threats unresolved.

2. `Complex Web Applications`: 
- With the continuous evolution of web applications, they have become dynamic and complex. Thus, making it difficult for scanners to identify all the vulnerabilities in the application.

3. `Performance Impact`: 
- Scanning can sometimes slow down web application performance, which can be disruptive to users and operations.

4. `Frequent Updates`: 
- Continuous updates and changes to web applications require frequent rescanning, which can be resource-intensive and challenging to manage.

5. `Custom Code`: 
- Unique, custom-built features of a web application may not be effectively scanned by automated tools, necessitating manual review.


### Web App Scanning vs. Web Vulnerability Scanning

| Aspect                  | Web Application Scanning                                                            | Web Vulnerability Scanning                                                                  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope                   | Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities specific to web applications.                | Focuses on vulnerabilities in web applications, servers, networks, and other components.    |
| Purpose                 | Its purpose is to secure web applications by detecting flaws and security risks.    | Provides a complete security scan of vulnerabilities associated with web applications.      |
| Common Tools            | OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Metasploit.                                              | Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys.                                                                |
| Types of Vulnerabilities| Vulnerabilities include SQL injection, XSS, and misconfigurations.                  | Includes web-specific vulnerabilities as well as network and servers.                       |
| Depth of Analysis       | Provides in-depth analysis of application-specific vulnerabilities.                 | Provides an analysis of the security posture, and vulnerabilities.                          |
| Automation vs. Manual   | This process uses automated tools.                                                  | It is usually done using automated tools but manual testing could also be done.             |
| Output                  | Detailed reports on application vulnerabilities.                                    | Comprehensive security reports.                                                             |


### Types of Web Application Scanning
- Web application scanning can be typically categorized into two types, which are:

1. `Static Application Security Testing (SAST)`
- SAST analyzes various aspects of the application. 
- These aspects include source code and bytecodes of the application that’s being tested. 
- It is termed a static tool because these tools perform the analysis without executing it.
- It scans for security flaws during the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle). 
- The vulnerabilities often include coding errors and flaws.
    + *Purpose*: Find vulnerabilities in the code during development.
    + *Benefits*: Helps developers fix issues before the application is run, making it more secure from the start.
    + *Examples*: Checkmarx, Fortify, Veracode.

2. `Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)`
- DAST identifies vulnerabilities in the web application effectively. 
- The tool finds these vulnerabilities by simulating attacks on the application and analyzes how the application responds. 
- This is helpful for attacks such as SQL injection and Cross-site scripting (XSS).
    + *Purpose*: Detect vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the application.
    + *Benefits*: Identifies security flaws that appear when the application is live and running.
    + *Examples*: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Netsparker, SQL Map, etc.
