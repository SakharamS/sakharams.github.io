## Introdution

- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a guide developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a U.S. government agency. 
- It provides a policy framework of computer security guidance for private sector organizations in the United States. 
- The framework is designed to help organizations manage and reduce their cybersecurity risk.
- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is composed of three main components:

1. `Core`: 
- The Core presents five functions—Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—that, when combined, provide a high-level, strategic view of an organization's management of cybersecurity risk.

2. `Profiles`: 
- A Profile represents the outcomes based on business needs that an organization has selected from the Framework Categories and Subcategories. 
- The Profile can be used to identify opportunities for improving cybersecurity posture by comparing a “Current” Profile with a “Target” Profile.

3. `Tiers`: 
- Tiers provide context on how an organization views cybersecurity risk and the processes in place to manage that risk. 
- Tiers describe the degree to which an organization’s cybersecurity risk management practices exhibit the characteristics defined in the Framework.


### Benefits
- The NIST Cybersecurity Framework offers several benefits to organizations:

1. `Risk Management`: 
- The framework helps organizations identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risk across the enterprise.

2. `Improved Communication`: 
- The common language provided by the framework facilitates better communication of cybersecurity issues among stakeholders, including IT staff, executives, and external partners.

3. `Compliance`: 
- The framework can help organizations meet regulatory requirements related to cybersecurity and demonstrate due diligence.

4. `Best Practices`: 
- The framework incorporates industry standards and best practices, allowing organizations to benefit from the collective experience and knowledge of cybersecurity professionals.

5. `Flexibility`: 
- The framework is designed to be adaptable to various sectors and organizations of different sizes. 
- It can be customized to fit an organization's unique risks, resources, and capabilities.

6. `Proactive Approach`: 
- By focusing on preventative measures like identifying threats and protecting assets, the framework encourages a proactive approach to cybersecurity, rather than a reactive one.

7. `Cost Savings`: 
- By preventing cybersecurity incidents, the framework can help organizations avoid the financial losses associated with data breaches and system downtime.
