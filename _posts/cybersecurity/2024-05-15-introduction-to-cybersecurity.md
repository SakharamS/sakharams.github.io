## Introdution
- Cybersecurity is a critical field in today's digital world, focused on protecting systems, networks, and data from digital attacks. - These attacks often aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, interrupt normal business processes, or implement ransomware attacks. 
- Cybersecurity measures are essential to protect both individuals and organizations from potential threats. 
- This includes 
    + Securing data in transit and at rest
    + Securing hardware and software
    + Network security
    + Ensuring recovery from a data breach or other incidents. 
- Cybersecurity covers a wide range of areas including application security, information security, network security, disaster recovery, and more. 
- As our reliance on digital platforms grows, so does the importance of robust cybersecurity measures.
- Cybersecurity is a broad field that encompasses several categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of security. Here are some of the main categories:

1. `Network Security`:
- Protects the integrity and usability of network and data by preventing and monitoring unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of the network and network-accessible resources.

2. `Application Security`: 
- Focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats by identifying, fixing, and enhancing the security of software applications.

3. `Information Security`: 
- Protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.

4. `Operational Security (OPSEC)`: 
- Involves the process of identifying and protecting sensitive information that could be used by adversaries to cause harm.

5. `Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity`: 
- Dictates how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data.

6. `End-User Education`: 
- Addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Users must understand the procedures for protecting personal and professional data.

7. `Cloud Security`: 
- A subset of cybersecurity that focuses on securing data, applications, and infrastructures in the cloud.

8. `Mobile Security`: 
- Focuses on protecting personal and business information stored on mobile devices.

9. `Data Loss Prevention (DLP)`: 
- Strategies for ensuring that end users do not send sensitive or critical information outside the corporate network.

10. `Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)`: 
- Tools that monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and issues alerts when such activity is discovered.
