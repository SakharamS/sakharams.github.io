## Security Measures

1. **Network Security**
- `Virtual Network Integration`: Deploy containers within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for secure, isolated network access.
- `Network Security Groups (NSGs)`: Apply NSGs to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to your containers.

2. **Identity and Access Management**
- `Managed Identity`: Assign a managed identity to your container group for secure access to other Azure services without managing credentials.
- `Azure Active Directory (AAD)`: Use AAD to manage access to your ACI resources and integrate with AAD for identity and access control.

3. **Secure Secrets Management**
- `Azure Key Vault`: Store sensitive information such as database connection strings, API keys, and other secrets in Azure Key Vault, and access them securely from your containers.
- `Environment Variables`: Pass secrets as environment variables, but ensure they are managed securely and not exposed in logs or code.

4. **TLS/SSL**
- Use TLS/SSL to encrypt data in transit to and from your container instances, especially if they are exposed to the internet.

5. **Image Security**
- `Trusted Registry`: Use trusted container registries like Azure Container Registry (ACR) and enable image scanning for vulnerabilities.
- `Private Images`: Use private images stored in ACR or other secure registries.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
- `Azure Monitor`: Use Azure Monitor to collect metrics and logs for your container instances.
- `Azure Security Center`: Enable Azure Security Center for advanced threat protection and security recommendations for your container instances.
