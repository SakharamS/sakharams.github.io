## Introduction
- In a Microsoft Sentinel Log Analytics Workspace (LAW), a variety of tables are created to store logs, metrics, and other data collected from different sources

### Tables by Solutions

### 1. **AzureResources**
- `ContainerLog`: This includes application logs, system logs, and other logs generated within the container environment.
- `KubePodInventory`: Contains inventory data about the pods running in your AKS clusters.
- `KubeNodeInventory`: Stores inventory data about the nodes in your AKS clusters.
- `KubeEvents`: Captures Kubernetes events, providing detailed information about events occurring within your AKS clusters, such as pod creations, deletions, scaling events, and errors.
- `KubePodNetworkInventory`: Contains network-related data about the pods in your AKS clusters, including information on IP addresses and network interfaces.
- `KubeContainerInventory`: Stores inventory data about the containers running within your AKS clusters, including container IDs, image names, statuses, and other relevant details.
- `KubePVInventory`: Contains inventory data about Persistent Volumes (PVs) in your AKS clusters, including volume names, capacities, statuses, and associated storage classes.
- `KubePersistentVolumeClaimInventory`: Stores inventory data about Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) in your AKS clusters, providing information about claim names, namespaces, statuses, and associated PVs.
- `KubeServices`: Contains data about the services running in your AKS clusters, including service names, types, cluster IPs, and associated endpoints.
- `KubeClusterInventory`: Provides inventory data about your AKS clusters, including cluster names, versions, and other high-level metadata.

### 2. **LogManagement**
- `AzureActivity`: - Contains Azure Activity logs, which provide insight into operations on resources in your subscription. 
- `SecurityEvent`: Stores data from Windows Security events, capturing information about various security-related events such as logons, privilege use, and policy changes.
- `Heartbeat`: Stores data about the health of your VMs, including status updates and heartbeat signals sent by the Azure Monitor agent.
- `Syslog`: Collects data from Linux Syslog, providing information about system events and logs.
- `AuditLogs`: Contains audit log data from Azure Active Directory, including information about user and group management activities, application activities, and directory-level events.
- `SigninLogs`: Stores sign-in activity data from Azure AD, capturing details about user sign-ins, including success and failure events.
- `AzureDiagnostics`: Collects diagnostic logs from various Azure services, providing detailed information about the operations and performance of these services.
- `OfficeActivity`: Contains data about user activities within Office 365, including information about emails, file access, and other actions taken within Office applications.
- `VMComputer`: Stores information about virtual machines, including metadata such as names, sizes, operating systems, and IP addresses.
- `CommonSecurityLog`: Contains data from various network security devices like firewalls, proxy servers, and other security appliances, using common formats like syslog.
- `WindowsEvent`: Collects data from Windows Event logs, providing a wide range of information about system and application events.
- `Alert`: Contains information about alerts generated by various security solutions integrated with Sentinel, including custom and analytic rule-based alerts.
- `AzureMetrics`: Stores metrics data from Azure services, providing performance and utilization information.
- `Usage`: Provides data on the usage and performance of Azure Monitor Logs, including the volume of data ingested, retention, and query performance.

### 3. **Microsoft Sentinel**
- `Anomalies`: Stores data about detected unusual patterns or behaviors that could indicate potential security threats.
- `SecurityAlert`: Contains data about security alerts generated by Azure Security Center, Sentinel, and other integrated security solutions.
- `SecurityIncident`: Contains data about incidents created in Microsoft Sentinel, which can group multiple related alerts into a single incident for easier management and investigation.
- `ThreatIntelligenceIndicator`: Contains threat intelligence data including indicators of compromise like malicious IPs, URLs, domains, and file hashes.

### 4. **Microsoft Sentinel User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)**
- `BehaviorAnalytics`: Captures behavioral patterns of users and entities to detect deviations that might signify security threats.
- `IdentityInfo`: Holds information about user identities and their metadata, such as roles, group memberships, and associated devices.
- `UserPeerAnalytics`: Stores data on user activities compared to their peer group norms to identify outliers and potential security risks.
