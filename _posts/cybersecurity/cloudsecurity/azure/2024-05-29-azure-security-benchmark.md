## Introduction to Azure Security Benchmark
- The Azure Security Benchmark (ASB) is a set of best practices and recommendations provided by Microsoft for securing Azure services. 
- It is designed to help organizations improve their security posture by implementing controls that are aligned with well-known security frameworks such as CIS Controls and NIST SP 800-53.
- The ASB includes various controls categorized into different domains to ensure comprehensive coverage of security aspects. 
- Below are the primary categories and some example controls within each category:

1. **Network Security**
- `Implement secure network configurations`: Use Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- `Secure the connectivity to Azure services`: Use private endpoints to connect securely to Azure services.

2. **Identity Management**
- `Strengthen authentication`: Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
- `Secure privileged access`: Use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources.

3. **Privileged Access**
- `Limit the number of privileged accounts`: Regularly review and minimize the number of accounts with administrative privileges.
- `Monitor and audit privileged activity`: Enable logging and monitoring for privileged account activities.

4. **Data Protection**
- `Ensure data encryption at rest`: Use Azure Disk Encryption and encryption features for databases and storage accounts.
- `Encrypt data in transit`: Use TLS/SSL to secure data in transit.

5. **Asset Management**
- `Inventory and manage assets`: Maintain an inventory of all Azure resources and ensure they are managed.
- `Secure asset configurations`: Regularly assess and remediate vulnerabilities in Azure resources.

6. **Logging and Monitoring**
- `Enable logging`: Use Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center to enable and collect logs.
- `Monitor security configurations and events`: Use Azure Sentinel for security information and event management (SIEM).

7. **Incident Response**
- `Prepare for incident response`: Develop and maintain an incident response plan.
- `Detect and respond to incidents`: Use Azure Security Center to detect and respond to security incidents.

8. **Posture and Vulnerability Management**
- `Assess security posture`: Regularly use Azure Security Center to assess the security posture of your Azure environment.
- `Manage vulnerabilities`: Use Azure Defender for continuous vulnerability management.

9. **Backup and Recovery**
- `Ensure data backup`: Implement regular backups for all critical data using Azure Backup.
- `Test recovery procedures`: Regularly test your backup and recovery procedures.

10. **Governance and Strategy**
- `Define security governance`: Establish security policies and ensure they are enforced across the organization.
- `Align with compliance requirements`: Ensure your Azure environment meets regulatory and compliance requirements.
