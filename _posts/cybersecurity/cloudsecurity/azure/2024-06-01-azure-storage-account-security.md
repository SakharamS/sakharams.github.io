## Security Measures to Secure the Storage Account

1. **Network Security**:
- `Virtual Network (VNet) Integration`: Use VNet service endpoints or private endpoints to restrict access to storage resources from specific VNets.
- `Firewalls and Virtual Networks`: Configure firewall rules to allow access from specific IP addresses or ranges.

2. **Encryption**
- `Encryption at Rest`: All data in Azure Storage is encrypted using Microsoft-managed keys by default. You can also use customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.
- `Encryption in Transit`: Data is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data as it travels between the client and Azure Storage.

3. **Access Control**
- `Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)`: Assign Azure roles to users, groups, or applications to control access to storage resources.
- `Shared Access Signatures (SAS)`: Provide fine-grained, time-limited access to storage resources.

4. **Advanced Threat Protection**
- `Azure Defender for Storage`: Provides threat detection and alerts for unusual and potentially harmful attempts to access or exploit storage accounts.

5. **Data Redundancy Options**
- `Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)`: Replicates data within a single datacenter.
- `Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)`: Replicates data across multiple datacenters within a region.
- `Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)`: Replicates data to a secondary region for additional durability.
- `Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (RA-GRS)`: Allows read access to the replicated data in the secondary region.

6. **Auditing and Monitoring**
- `Storage Analytics`: Provides logging and metrics to monitor storage account activity.
- `Azure Monitor`: Integrates with Azure Monitor to provide detailed insights and alerts for storage account operations.
