## Introduction

1. **Potential Bugs**: 
- Identify potential bugs by analyzing code for known patterns and anti-patterns that commonly lead to bugs. 
- Flag issues like null pointer dereferences, resource leaks, and other common programming errors.

2. **Coding Rules**: 
- Enforce coding rules based on industry standards (like MISRA, CERT, etc.) and customizable rules defined by the user or team. 
- Ensure adherence to coding practices such as naming conventions, code formatting, and style consistency.

3. **Testing** 
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines and test frameworks to perform testing of the source code. 
- Report on code coverage metrics, ensuring that adequate testing is performed and identifying areas of code that lack sufficient coverage.

4. **Duplication**
- Detect duplicated code across projects, helping to reduce redundancy and promoting code reuse. 
- Highlight areas where code could be refactored into reusable components, thereby improving maintainability and reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

5. **Comments**
- Analyze comments to ensure they are meaningful and aligned with code changes. 
- It can detect missing or outdated comments, as well as overly complex comments that may indicate unclear code.

6. **Architecture and Design**
- Assess software architecture and design by analyzing dependencies, coupling, and cohesion metrics. 
- Identify architectural flaws such as cyclic dependencies or overly complex class structures that could impact maintainability and scalability.

7. **Complexity**
- Measure code complexity using metrics like cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity. 
- Flag methods or classes that are overly complex, making them harder to understand and maintain.
