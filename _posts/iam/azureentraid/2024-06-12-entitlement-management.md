## Introduction
- Entitlement management is a feature in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) that helps organizations manage and govern access to resources. 
- It streamlines the process of assigning, reviewing, and managing user access permissions, ensuring that users have the appropriate access to applications, groups, and other resources based on their roles and responsibilities.

### Key Features of Entitlement Management 
1. `Access Packages`: 
- Bundles of resources (applications, groups, SharePoint sites) that users can request access to. 
- Access packages define the conditions under which users can request and be granted access.

2. `Policies`: 
- Define the rules for access requests, including who can request access, approval workflows, and access review schedules. 
- Policies help ensure that access is granted appropriately and reviewed periodically.

3. `Lifecycle Management`: 
- Automates the process of granting, reviewing, and removing access based on predefined criteria. 
- This includes automatic removal of access when it is no longer needed.

4. `Approval Workflows`: 
- Customizable workflows that require one or more approvers to review and approve access requests before access is granted.

5. `Access Reviews`: 
- Regularly scheduled reviews to ensure that users still need the access they have been granted. This helps maintain compliance and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.

6. `Delegation`: 
- Allows resource owners and managers to delegate access management tasks to other users, distributing the responsibility for access governance.

### Benefits of Entitlement Management
1. `Improved Security`: Ensures that users have only the access they need, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
2. `Compliance`: Helps organizations meet regulatory and compliance requirements by providing a structured approach to access management and reviews.
3. `Efficiency`: Automates the access request and approval process, reducing the administrative burden on IT staff and speeding up access provisioning.
4. `User Empowerment`: Enables users to request access to the resources they need, streamlining their ability to perform their job functions.
Auditability: Provides detailed logs and reports of access requests, approvals, and reviews, aiding in auditing and compliance efforts.

### Use Cases
1. `Onboarding New Employees`: Quickly provision new employees with the access they need based on their role within the organization.
2. `Project-Based Access`: Grant access to specific resources for the duration of a project, and automatically revoke access when the project ends.
3. `External Collaborators`: Provide temporary access to external users (e.g., partners or contractors) and ensure it is revoked when no longer needed.
4. `Periodic Access Reviews`: Regularly review and confirm that users still require the access they have been granted, ensuring ongoing compliance.


### How It Works
1. `Create Access Packages`: Define the resources that users can request access to, such as applications, groups, and SharePoint sites.
2. `Define Policies`: Set the rules for who can request access, the approval process, and the duration of access.
3. `User Requests Access`: Users request access to an access package through a self-service portal.
4. `Approval Workflow`: Access requests are routed through the defined approval workflow for review and approval.
5. `Access Granted`: Once approved, access is automatically provisioned to the user.
6. `Access Review`: Periodically review access to ensure it is still needed and revoke access when it is no longer required.
