- Building a Machine Learning (ML) model package involves several steps. Here's a high-level overview:

| Steps | Description | 
| ----- | ----------- |
| 1. Data Collection | Gather and organize your data. <br> This could involve scraping data from the web, collecting data through surveys, using pre-existing datasets, etc. | 
| 2. Data Preprocessing |  Clean and transform your data. <br> This could involve handling missing values, dealing with outliers, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical variables, etc. | 
| 3. Feature Selection/Engineering | Identify the most relevant features to use for your model, or create new features from the existing ones. |
| 4. Model Selection | Choose the type of model that's most appropriate for your task (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, neural network, etc.). | 
| 5.Model Training | Train your model on your training data. <br>  This involves feeding your data through the model, and adjusting the model's parameters based on the output. |
| 6.Model Evaluation | Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics. <br> This could involve looking at accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, etc., depending on the task. |
| 7. Hyperparameter Tuning | Adjust the model's hyperparameters to improve performance. |
| 8.Model Validation | Validate your model using a separate validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data. |
| 9.Model Deployment | Once you're satisfied with your model's performance, deploy it so it can be used to make predictions on new data.|
| 10. Model Monitoring and Updating | After deployment, monitor your model's performance over time. <br>  If its performance drops, or if new data becomes available, you may need to retrain or update your model. |



1. Create Package
2. Maintain the seperate modules.
3. Maintain seperate files for preprocessing, data handling, manual configuration, etc.
4. Build test cases - verify the integrity.
