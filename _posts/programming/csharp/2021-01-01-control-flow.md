# Control Flow and Iterations

- The flow of execution refers to the order in which the code of a program is executed or evaluated.
- Below are the control flow statements:

| Conditional Statements | Syntax | 
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| If-else |	If condition <br> else if condition <br> else if condition <br> else condition |
| Switch Case | switch(variable) <br> { <br> &emsp; case (condition): <br> &emsp; break <br>  &emsp; case (condition): <br> &emsp; break <br> &emsp; Default: <br> &emsp; break <br> } | 

- Iterations statements are used to loop through a block of code as long as the condition is true.

| Iterations | Syntax | 
| ---------- | ------ |
| For Loop | for (var i = 1; i <=10; i++) <br> { <br> &emsp; statements... <br> } |
| Foreach Loop | foreach(var number in numbers) <br> { <br> &emsp; statements... <br> } | 
| While Loop | while(condition) <br> { <br> &emsp; statements... <br> } |
| Do While Loop | do <br> { <br>&emsp; statements... <br> }while(condition) |
