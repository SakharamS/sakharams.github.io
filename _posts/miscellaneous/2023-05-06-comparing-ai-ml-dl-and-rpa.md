1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**
    a. Image Recognition: Identifying objects, people, and patterns in images.
    b. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Understanding and processing human language.
    c. Robotics: Developing intelligent machines capable of performing tasks autonomously.
    d. Expert Systems: Creating systems that mimic human decision-making processes.

2. **Machine Learning (ML):**
    a. Supervised Learning: Training models using labeled data to make predictions or classifications.
    b. Unsupervised Learning: Identifying patterns and relationships in data without labeled examples.
    c. Reinforcement Learning: Teaching models to make decisions based on feedback from their actions.

3. **Deep Learning:**
    a. Neural Networks: Building networks of interconnected nodes (neurons) to learn complex patterns.
    b. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image recognition and processing.
    c. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Suitable for sequence data like text or time series.
    
4. **Robotic Process Automation (RPA):**
    a. Task Automation: Automating repetitive tasks such as data entry, form processing, and report generation.
    b. Workflow Automation: Streamlining business processes by integrating with various applications and systems.
    c. Cognitive Automation: Incorporating AI and ML to enable robots to learn and adapt to new tasks.
