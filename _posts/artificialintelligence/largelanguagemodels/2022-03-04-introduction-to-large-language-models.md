- Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence model that are trained on a vast amount of text data. They are designed to generate human-like text based on the input they are given.
- LLMs can understand context, generate responses to prompts, and even write essays or code. They are used in a variety of applications, including chatbots, translation services, content creation, and more.
- One of the most well-known LLMs is GPT-3, developed by OpenAI. It has 175 billion parameters and was trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text.
- However, while LLMs are powerful, they also have limitations. They don't truly understand text in the way humans do and can sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical responses. They also require a lot of computational resources to train and run.
