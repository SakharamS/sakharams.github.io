## Introduction to Azure AI
- Aritificial Intelligence is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

- Types of AI:
1. `Strong AI`
- Intelligence of machine = Intelligence of human
- A machine that can solve problems, learn, and plan for the future.
- An expert at everthing.
- Learns like a child, building on it's own experiences.

2. `Narrow/Weak AI`
- Focuses on specific task
- Examples: Self driving cars and virtual assistants
- *Machine Learning*: Learn from data


### Building AI Solutions in Azure
1. `Use Pre-Trained Models`
- Example: Azure Cognitive Services
    + Get intelligence from text, images, audio, video

2. `Build Simple Models`
- Without needing data scientists
- Example: Custom Vision
- Example: Azure Machine Learning
    + Automated machine learning

3. `Build Complex Models`
- Using data scientists and team
- Build your own ML models from ZERO (code-experienced)
- Example: Using Azure Machine Learning

### Types of AI Workloads
1. `Content Moderation & Personalization`
- Filtering inappropiate content on socoal media
- Recommending products based on user history
- Adjusting website content based on user preferences

2. `Computer Vision Workloads`
- Facial recognition systems
- Self-driving car navigation systems
- Object detection in surveillance videos
- Augmented reality applications

3. `Natural Language Processing Workloads`
- Language translation services
- Voice recongition and response systems
- Sentiment analysis in customer feedback

4. `Knowledge Mining Workloads`
- Analyzing large datasets to uncover trends
- Extracting useful information from unstructured data
- Mining customer data for insights
- Predictive analytics in business intelligence

5. `Document Intelligence Workloads`
- Automated invoice processing
- Resume parsing for recruitment
- Document classification and archiving
- Data extraction from legel documents

6. `Generative AI Workloads`
- Creating new images or text based on learned patterns
- AI-generated music or art
- Automated content generation for social media
