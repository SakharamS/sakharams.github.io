## Introduction 
- Azure AI offers a comprehensive set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) services and capabilities through its Azure Cognitive Services.
- These services enable developers to integrate advanced NLP features into their applications to analyze, understand, and generate human language. 

### Azure Cognitive Services for Language
1. `Text Analytics`: 
- Provides APIs for sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection, and named entity recognition (NER).

2. `Translator`: 
- Offers real-time translation of text between multiple languages, including transliteration and dictionary lookup capabilities.

3. `Language Understanding (LUIS)`: 
- Allows you to build custom machine-learning models to understand user intents and extract relevant information from natural language text.

4. `Speech to Text and Text to Speech`: 
- Converts spoken language into written text and vice versa, supporting a variety of languages and dialects.

5. `QnA Maker`: 
- Enables the creation of a question-and-answer layer over your data, such as FAQs, manuals, and documents, to provide natural language responses to user queries.

6. `Azure OpenAI Service`: 
- Provides access to powerful language models like GPT-3, enabling tasks such as text generation, summarization, and more.
