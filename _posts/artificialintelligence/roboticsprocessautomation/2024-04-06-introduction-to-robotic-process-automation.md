- RPA is the use of easily programmable software to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously were manually performed by humans.
- Robots are automating blue-collar jobs. For example, they are beginning to replace truck drivers, factory workers and many other labour-intensive roles. 
- RPA is also automating white-collar jobs. Many companies are pivoting from people to software for high-volume highly-transactional manual processes.
- RPA is sometimes misunderstood and confusion may arise between RPA and Intelligent Automation (IA). The difference lies in the fact that RPA is the application of technology which enables computer software configuration to partially or fully automate human activities which are manual, repetitive or rulebased. 
- On the other hand, intelligent automation intends to mimic human behavior, such as perceiving, gathering evidence or reasoning. It is for this reason that IA is best for processes which involve unstructured data from non-standard sources.


#### Benefits of RPA
1. Works around the clock
2. No days off.
3. Accuracy
4. More speed for executing tasks
5. Built-in Tracking Systems
6. Scalable
7. Increase human morale
8. Massive Cost Savings

#### Risks of RPA
1. Looking at the RPA project from an IT stand point rather than a business stand point
2. Targeting the wrong processes
3. Cultural Change Management
4. Automating too much
5. Trusting only on the skill and not the experience of the RPA consultant
