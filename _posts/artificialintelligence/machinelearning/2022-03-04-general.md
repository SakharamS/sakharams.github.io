Main Ingredients for Machine Learning
1. Data
2. Training
3. Hardware

CPU - Central Processing Unit
- Used to all the tasks that are performed on a computer.
GPU - Graphics Processing Unit 
- Dedicated high performance chip used for machine learning

Features
- Input Data
Label
- Output
Training DataSet
- A large group of lableled examples.
ML Training Phase
- 
ML Trained Model
- 

Inference
- 

Under-fitting Model
- 
- Reasons:
    1. Too Simple Model
    2. Training data is not enough
Over-fitting Model
- 
- Reasons:
    1. Training dataaset is a SAMPLE
    2. Too Complex Model


Classification of ML Systems:
1. Supervised Learning
- Classification
Classifier
Support Vector Machines (SVM's)
- Regression
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Polynomial Regression

2. Unsupervised Learning
- Clustering
    * Task of identifying similar instances with shared attributes in a dataset and group them together into clusters.
    * The output of the algorithm would be a set of labels assigning each data point to one of the identified clusters. 
- Dimension Reduction
    * 

3. Reinforcement Learning
