1. Google AI
- Cancer detection
- Help pathalogists to improve the diagnosis of cancer.
- Google AI worked on a large data set to develop a DL algorithm that can properly identify metastassis with 89% accuracy.


2. Spotify
- Deep learning algorithms detect patterns within the vast amount of data to find users with similar music taste.

3. GoldSpot Discoveries
- Using DL to analyse geological data, GoldSpot Discoveries developed a predictive method for finding gold deposits.
- Correctly identify 86% of existing gold deposits in Quebec, despiste working off data from just 4% of the total surface area.

4. Digital Domain
- Using a DL algorithm trained on high resolution scans of actors face to render the character in real time.
- This gave the director unprecedented insight into how th e movie will look during the actual shooting, rather than waiting for days.

5. Ayasdi
- Anit Money laundering

6. Deep Instinct
- Deep Learning for Security
- Using Deep Instinct's DL-powered security platform, the algorithm found 12 infected endpoints within 1st week and detected that almost 10% of their devices were infected.

7. Doxel
- Productivity Tracking

8. Amazon Rekognition
- Facial Recognition

9. Zestimate
- Deep Learning for real state markets
- To analyze the home characteristics, unique features and market data to predict the price of almost 100 million homes in the US.

10.  Zest Finance
- DL for Loan Approval
- DL analyses a potential customer's credit score and determines their risk of defaulting.
