GitLab CI/CD is a powerful continuous integration and continuous deployment tool provided by GitLab. It allows developers to automate the build, test, and deployment processes of their applications.

With GitLab CI/CD, you can define pipelines as code using a YAML file called `.gitlab-ci.yml`. This file describes the stages and jobs of your pipeline, allowing you to specify the steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

Some key features of GitLab CI/CD include:

- **Parallel Execution**: GitLab CI/CD allows you to run multiple jobs in parallel, speeding up your build and test processes.

- **Artifacts**: You can define artifacts in your pipeline, which are files generated during the build process and can be used in subsequent stages or jobs.

- **Environments**: GitLab CI/CD provides a way to define environments, such as staging and production, where you can deploy your application. This allows for easy and controlled deployments.

- **Integration with GitLab**: GitLab CI/CD is tightly integrated with GitLab, providing a seamless experience for managing your source code, issues, and pipelines in one place.

Here's a sample GitLab CI/CD pipeline configuration:
