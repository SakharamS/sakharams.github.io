### Core DevOps Principles
The DevOps methodology comprises four key principles that guide the effectiveness and efficiency of application development and deployment. These principles, listed below, center on the best aspects of modern software development.

1. Automation of the software development lifecycle:
-   This includes automating testing, builds, releases, the provisioning of development environments, and other manual tasks that can slow down or introduce human error into the software delivery process.
2. Collaboration and communication:
-  A good DevOps team has automation, but a great DevOps team also has effective collaboration and communication.
3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste:
- From automating repetitive tasks to watching performance metrics for ways to reduce release times or mean-time-to-recovery, high performing DevOps teams are regularly looking for areas that could be improved.
4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops:
- Through automation, improved communication and collaboration, and continuous improvement, DevOps teams can take a moment and focus on what real users really want, and how to give it to them.
