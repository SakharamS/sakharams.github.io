## Introduction
- Namespaces in Kubernetes provide a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users or teams. 
- They are virtual clusters within a physical cluster, allowing for isolation and resource management. 
- Each namespace has its own set of resources, such as pods, services, and deployments, which are independent of resources in other namespaces. 
- This helps in organizing and managing applications and resources in a more efficient and scalable manner.

- Sample YAML:
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Namespace
  metadata:
    name: my-namespace
  ```

- Common use-cases for using namespaces:

1. **Resource Management**: 
- You can allocate resources among the different namespaces, effectively creating a form of quota for teams or projects. 
- This helps prevent one team or project from using up all the resources.

2. **Access Control**: 
- You can use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to control who can access what within each namespace. 
- This allows you to isolate teams or projects from each other, providing a level of security.

3. **Environment Isolation**: 
- You can use namespaces to create isolated environments for different stages of your application lifecycle, like development, testing, and production. 
- Each environment can have its own set of resources, configurations, and access controls.

4. **Organizational Efficiency**: 
- Namespaces can reflect your organization's structure, with each department, team, or user getting their own namespace. 
- This can make it easier to manage and locate resources.

5. **Multi-tenancy**: 
- If you're a service provider, you can use namespaces to create a multi-tenant environment, where each tenant has their own isolated namespace.
