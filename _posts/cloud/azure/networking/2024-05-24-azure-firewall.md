## Introduction
- Azure Firewall is a managed, cloud-based network security service provided by Microsoft Azure. 
- It offers comprehensive, centralized network and application-level protection to safeguard your Azure Virtual Network resources.

### Key Features of Azure Firewall
1. `Stateful Firewall`:
- Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall, meaning it tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on the context of the traffic.

2. `Built-in High Availability`:
- The service is inherently designed for high availability with built-in failover capabilities, ensuring continuous protection.

3. `Scalability`:
- Azure Firewall automatically scales with your network traffic, providing consistent protection without manual intervention.

4. `Network and Application Rules`:
- **Network Rules**: Control inbound and outbound network traffic based on source and destination IP address, port, and protocol.
- **Application Rules**:** Control outbound HTTP/S traffic by defining fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) or URL-based rules.

5. `Threat Intelligence`:
- Azure Firewall can be configured to alert or deny traffic from/to known malicious IP addresses and domains using Microsoft’s threat intelligence feed.

6. `Logging and Analytics`:
- Logs all traffic and can be integrated with Azure Monitor, Azure Sentinel, or third-party SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions for detailed analysis and monitoring.

7. `Integration with Other Azure Services`:
- Easily integrates with Azure Virtual Network, Azure Application Gateway, Azure VPN Gateway, and other Azure services.


### NAT (Network Address Translation) rules 
- NAT rules in Azure Firewall allow you to configure how traffic is translated as it passes through the firewall. 
= These rules are essential for managing inbound and outbound traffic and enabling secure and efficient communication between your internal network and external networks. 

### Types of NAT Rules 
1. `Inbound NAT Rules`:
- Used to translate and route incoming traffic from an external source (e.g., the internet) to a private IP address within your Azure Virtual Network.
- Commonly used for scenarios where external users need to access services hosted within your virtual network, such as web servers or other applications.

2. `Outbound NAT Rules`:
- Used to translate and route outgoing traffic from a private IP address within your virtual network to an external destination (e.g., the internet).
- Ensures that traffic from your internal resources appears to come from a single public IP address or a pool of public IP addresses.


### Key Benefits
1. **Enhanced Security**:
- Provides robust protection for your Azure Virtual Network with both network and application-level filtering.

2. **Simplified Management**:
- As a managed service, Azure Firewall simplifies network security management, removing the need to deploy, scale, or maintain firewall appliances.

3. **Consistent Policy Enforcement**:
- Centralizes network security policy enforcement across multiple subscriptions and virtual networks.

4. **Cost Efficiency**:
- Reduces the need for separate firewall appliances, potentially lowering overall costs while benefiting from Azure’s scalability.

#### Use Cases
1. `Perimeter Network Protection`:
- Acts as a barrier between your Azure Virtual Network and the internet or other external networks, controlling traffic flow and protecting against external threats.

2. `East-West Traffic Filtering`:
- Inspects and filters internal traffic between subnets and virtual networks, preventing lateral movement of threats within your environment.

3. `Application Protection`:
- Protects your applications by controlling outbound traffic and preventing access to malicious domains.


### Routing Traffic through Firewall
- By setting up a route table with a UDR and associating it with your VM's subnet, you can ensure that all traffic from the VM is routed through Azure Firewall. 
- This setup enhances security by allowing Azure Firewall to inspect and control the traffic, providing centralized management of network security policies.
- Steps:
    1. Set Up Azure Firewall
        - a. Deploy Azure Firewall
        - b. Create a Public IP for Azure Firewall
        - c. Associate the Public IP with the Firewall
    2. Create an Azure Route Table
        - a. Create a Route Table
        - b. Create a Route in the Route Table
    3. Associate the Route Table with the Subnet
    4. Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs)
        - a. Allow Traffic to and from Azure Firewall
    5. Verify and Test the setup


### Application Rules in Azure Firewall
- Azure Firewall's application rules provide a powerful mechanism for controlling outbound traffic based on URLs and FQDNs. 
- By defining granular access policies, you can enforce security measures, comply with regulatory requirements, optimize network traffic, and gain visibility into application-level traffic patterns within your Azure Virtual Network.
