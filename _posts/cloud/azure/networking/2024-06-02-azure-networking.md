2. **Private Endpoint**
    - Scenario: You have an Azure SQL Database that you want to securely access from your VNet without exposing it to the public internet.
    - Implementation Steps:
        + a. Create a private endpoint for the Azure SQL Database within your VNet.
        + b. Configure DNS to resolve the private endpoint.

3. **Private Link**

    - Implementation Steps:
        + a. Create a private endpoint for the desired Azure service.
        + b. Configure a private DNS zone to resolve the service's private endpoint.

4. **Private Link Service**
    - Scenario: You are an ISV providing a database service to multiple customers and want to offer secure access to your service via private endpoints
    - Implementation Steps:
        + a. Create a Private Link Service and expose your service via Private Link. 
        + b. Enable customers to create private endpoints in their VNets to access your service.
