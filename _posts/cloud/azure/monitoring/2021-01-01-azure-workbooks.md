## Introduction
- Azure Workbooks is a feature of Azure Monitor. 
- Workbooks provide a flexible canvas for data analysis and the creation of rich visual reports within the Azure portal. 
- Customers use Workbooks to explore the usage of an app, to do root cause analysis, put together an operational playbook, and many other tasks.

- The real power of Workbooks is the ability to combine data from disparate sources within a single report to provide insights into the availability, performance, usage, and overall health of the underlying components.
- You can create composite resource views or joins across resources enabling richer data and insights that would otherwise be impossible.
- Workbooks are currently compatible with the following data sources:
    + Logs
    + Metrics
    + Azure Resource Graph
    + Alerts
    + Workload Health
    + Azure Resource Health
    + Azure Data Explorer
