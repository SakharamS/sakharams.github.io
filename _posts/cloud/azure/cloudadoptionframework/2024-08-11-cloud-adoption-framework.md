## Introduction
- The Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) is a set of best practices, guidelines, and tools provided by Microsoft to help organizations successfully adopt and manage cloud services. 
- Itâ€™s like a roadmap that guides you through each step of moving to and operating in the cloud, ensuring you get the most out of your cloud investments.


### Phases of Cloud Adoption Framework

| `Strategy` | Define why you want to move to the cloud and what you hope to achieve. | 
| `Plan` | Make a detailed plan for how you'll move to the cloud, including timelines and resources. | 
| `Ready` | Get your cloud environment prepared for migration by setting up the necessary infrastructure and tools. | 
| `Migrate` | Move your applications and data to the cloud. | 
| `Innovate` | Take advantage of cloud technologies to create new solutions or improve existing ones. | 
| `Secure` | Make sure your cloud environment is protected against threats and complies with security standards. | 
|  `Manage` | Continuously monitor and optimize your cloud environment to keep it running smoothly. | 
| `Govern` | Set rules and policies to manage and secure your cloud environment effectively. | 
| `Organize` | Align the teams and roles supporting your organization's cloud adoption efforts. |
